== mccmnc.py ==

To run mccmnc.py:
1. Create a settings file settings/mccmny.josn under this directory.

{
 "apiPassword": "password",
 "apiUsername": "username"
}

2. Ensure you have the dependencies defined in mccmnc.py. On a Mac 
you might use pip2.7 to install them. This runs with Python 2.7. It's
usually easiest to try running python mccmnc.py and installing as
needed. On the event logging server the dependencies are as of
15-Dec-2014 already installed.

3. If necessary, set your PYTHONPATH variable prior to executing:

export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages

4. Run using the usage defined in mccmnc.py.

python mccmnc.py dbhost dbname mysql_cnf_path YYMMDD[HH...]

To schedule mccmnc.py, on the event logging server:

Add an email address to a file named "email" in your home directory.
If you want multiple email addresses, add them space separated.

Create a file mccmnc.sh in your home directory with the following contents:

#! /bin/sh

cd $HOME
DATE=`date --date="yesterday" "+%Y%m%d"`
EMAIL=`cat email`
python mccmnc.py dbhost dbname mysql_cnf_path $DATE | mailx -s "IP Mismatches for $DATE" $EMAIL


Then add the following to your crontab with crontab -e:

PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games
HOME=/home/username
# once daily:
15 14 * * * /home/username/mccmnc.sh &> /dev/null

Of course, replace "username" with your username on the event logging server.
